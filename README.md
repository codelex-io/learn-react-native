# Day One

## Functions & Class Components

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

-   [Function and Class Components @reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components)
-   [How Are Function Components Different from Classes? @overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/how-are-function-components-different-from-classes/)

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Create a _Hello World!_ component using a function and using a class.

## Props

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

-   [Component and Props @reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
-   [Props @facebook.github.io/react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props)

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

You probably already know a few programming related skills, for example - Git, JavaScript, TypeScript, React etc.

Let's write down some of the skills you know (up to five) in an app main view. Each of the skill must contain name and a logo or emoji of your choice. Since everything in React is about the reusability of the components, we are going to create a separate component called _Skill_ and pass props to it from _App_.

## State

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

-   [State and Lifecycle @reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
-   [State @facebook.github.io/react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state)

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Props exercise allowed us to render stateless list of the skills, but what if we would like to have some state for each of the skills? For example - how many hours we have spent on perfecting each them?

Let's update our _Skill_ component, it must have a counter of hours inside and when you tap on it - counter must increase by one hour.

You must understand one not really clear concept for many beginners - function can be passed as property, read more [Passing Functions to Components @reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-functions.html)

Now _Skill_ component became **stateful** instead of **stateless**, read more [Stateful and Stateless Components in React @programmingwithmosh.com](https://programmingwithmosh.com/javascript/stateful-stateless-components-react/).

Is it possible to leave _Skill_ component stateless but lift up to _App_ component? It is called [lifting state up @reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html).

## Style

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

-   [Style @facebook.github.io/react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/style)
-   [Applying Basic Styles in React Native @egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-applying-basic-styles-in-react-native)
-   [Style Components with StyleSheet @egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-native-style-components-in-a-react-native-app-with-stylesheet)
-   [Using Styled Components with React Native @levelup.gitconnected.com](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/using-styled-components-with-react-native-de645fcf4787)

Why do we need to use _StyleSheet_? It is immutable, and fails if we will try to use non-existing property or pass wrong value to any of the properties.

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Let's make our skill list cleaner, add:

-   title
-   background color
-   align & center skills
-   style each skill based on the hours spent, for example more hours makes it darker than others

Try styling the components using Styled Components.

## Height & Width

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

-   [Height and Width @facebook.github.io/react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/height-and-width)

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Make title to consume 25% of the screen height, do that using fixed dimensions and flex dimensions.

## Layout with Flexbox

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

-   [Layout with Flexbox @facebook.github.io/react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flexbox)
-   [Flex Direction @yogalayout.com](https://yogalayout.com/docs/flex-direction)

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Let's just recreate an examples from the documentation [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flexbox).

## ScrollView / List Views

-   [Using a ScrollView @facebook.github.io/react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/using-a-scrollview)
-   [Using List Views @facebook.github.io/react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/using-a-listview)

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Now let's get back to our previous _Skill_ component. What happens if there are 20 skills? And 20000?

## Built in Components

-   [Components and APIs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis.html)

## StoryBook [@storybook.js.org](https://storybook.js.org)

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Navigate to [./index.js](./index.js), set `IS_STORYBOOK` property to `true`.

Now we are going to recreate screens from the [E-Commerce App Template](https://www.figma.com/file/fxBQAYFEsi7L4Oix12qaiF/E-commerce-Application-by-Fively-%2F-Dark), by the way there is also [a light theme available](https://www.figma.com/file/51dVhgTOHJtVoZCuN5RSVb/E-commerce-Application-by-Fively-%2F-Light)

Recreate screens in the following order:

- Sign Up Page
- Login Page
- Forgot Password
- Main 3
- Categories
- Catalog 2
- Product Card
- Product Card / Select Size
- My Bag
- My Bag / Checkout

# Day One - Home Assignment

Complete as much screens as you can for our E-Commerce App. 

# Day Two

## Adding SVG

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

WTF is SVG? Basically it is an image which consists of vectors, in simpler words - just points and lines. When using SVG we can scale images endlessly without loosing quality.

- [Scalable Vector Graphics @wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)
- [SVG Tutorial @w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp)
- [SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics @developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

React-Native does not support SVG by default, but there are a library from the `react-native-community` for that - [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg).

Using SVG draw:

 - few geometric figures using provided components
 - try to draw an examples found in [assets](./src/assets)
 - draw svg using file from the internet

## Images

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

There is a separate section about the images in the documentation - [Images @facebook.github.io](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/images).

- there is a special image handling for different screen densities

As mentioned already, images work very similary to `img` tag in html. Note a few differences, as stated in the - documentation - [Image @facebook.github.io](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image)

- you must manually specify width & height for the network images
- GIF & WebP does not work by default on Android

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

- draw icons found in [icons](./src/assets/icons) and note that quality does not suffer using png
- draw some random network images
- can you set an image as a background?
- what is [prefetch](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image#prefetch)?

## Gradient

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

![Gradient](./assets/gradient.gif)

Unfortunately gradient does not work by default as well, there is yet another library from the `react-native-community` - [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-linear-gradient)

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

We have a button in our *E-Commerce App* designs, try adding some gradient to it.

## Navigation

ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„

One of the most complex parts in the mobile development is navigation. [Documentation @facebook.github.io](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation) suggests that you should use [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html).

There is one thing about [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html) - **YOU MUST READ THE DOCUMENTATION** to fully understand what you are doing.

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

- take a look at the guides:
    - [Tab Based Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/tab-based-navigation.html)
    - [Drawer Based Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/drawer-based-navigation.html)
    - [Type checking with TypeScript](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/typescript.html)
